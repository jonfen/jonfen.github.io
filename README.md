# A Visual Farnsworth CW Trainer

This is a small personal project designed to help me learn Morse code
for ham radio use.

There are many good CW trainers available out there, but this one is
an experiemnt to see if visual feedback is helpful for the learning
process. The idea is that as the CW is playing, the character
currently being sent is flashed on the screen. It is my hypothesis
that this visual reinforcement will help me learn the rhythm and
pattern of each character more effectively, but I do not yet know if
this is true.
